# What is DSA

DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms. It is a fundamental concept in computer science that involves organizing and storing data efficiently (Data Structures) and solving problems using step-by-step procedures (Algorithms). Understanding DSA is crucial for writing efficient and optimized code, which is essential for developing high-performance applications.

## Data Structures

Data structures are ways to organize and store data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Examples include:

- **Arrays**: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
- **Linked Lists**: A linear collection of data elements, where the linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
- **Stacks**: A collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queues**: A collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Trees**: A hierarchical structure that consists of nodes, with a single node as the root and sub-nodes as children.
- **Graphs**: A collection of nodes connected by edges, used to represent pairwise relations between objects.

## Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. Examples include:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Methods to arrange data in a particular order. Examples are quicksort, mergesort, and bubblesort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Techniques to find specific data within a structure. Examples are binary search and linear search.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Procedures to solve problems related to graph theory. Examples are Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths and Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.

Mastering DSA helps in improving problem-solving skills and is often a key focus in technical interviews for software development roles.
